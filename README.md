A simple Ludo game built with React where players can select a number, roll the die, and earn points based on matching conditions. The game dynamically updates the score and provides an engaging user experience.

Features
Number Selection: The user selects a number between 1 and 6 before rolling the die.
Dice Roll: A random number (1-6) is generated when the user rolls the die.
Scoring Rules:
If the selected number matches the die roll, the user earns +5 points.
If both the selected number and the die roll are either even or odd, the user earns +2 points.
If neither condition is met, the user loses 5 points.
